<li>to compile the code, using GNU compiler collection (GCC), enter "gcc" into terminal followed by the name of C file name and full pathname, e.g. "/desktop/usingIteration.c"</li>

<li>this compiles the code into native machine language in the form of a new file called "a.out"</li>

</li>cd to directory of this a.out file</li>

<li>enter "a.out" file with its full pathname</li>

<li>this will run the program.</li>
